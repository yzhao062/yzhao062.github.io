Dr. Yue Zhao is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southern California and a faculty member of the USC Machine Learning Center. He leads the FORTIS Lab (Foundations Of Reliable and Trustworthy Intelligent Systems), where his research focuses on developing reliable, safe, and scalable AI—from advancing the scientific foundations of anomaly and out-of-distribution detection to improving the safety and robustness of large language models and agentic systems. His work integrates core reliability and safety principles with open-source machine learning systems and high-impact applications in science and society.

Dr. Zhao has authored over 60 papers in top-tier venues and is internationally recognized for his open-source contributions—including PyOD, PyGOD, TDC, and TrustLLM—which collectively exceed 35 million downloads and 22,000 GitHub stars. His tools are widely used across academia, industry, and government, including by NASA, Tesla, Morgan Stanley, and the U.S. Senate. He has received numerous honors such as the Capital One Research Award, Amazon Research Awards, AAAI New Faculty Highlights, Google Cloud Research Innovators, Norton Labs Fellowship, Meta AI4AI Research Award, the Carnegie Mellon University Presidential Fellowship, the 2025 SIGSPATIAL Best Short Paper Award, and the Second Prize CCC Award at the IEEE ICDM 2025 BlueSky Track. He also serves as an Associate or Action Editor for the ACM Transactions on AI for Science, the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, and the Journal of Data-Centric Machine Learning Research, and as an Area Chair for major conferences including ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS.
