Dr. Yue Zhao is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southern California and a faculty member of the USC Machine Learning Center. He leads the FORTIS Lab (Foundations Of Reliable, Transparent, and Intelligent Systems), where his research focuses on developing reliable, safe, and scalable AI—from foundational algorithms for anomaly and out-of-distribution detection to enhancing the safety and reliability of large language models and agentic systems. His work bridges algorithmic foundations, open-source machine learning systems, and high-impact applications in science and society. Dr. Zhao has authored over 60 papers in top-tier venues and is internationally recognized for his open-source contributions—including PyOD, PyGOD, TDC, and TrustLLM—which collectively exceed 30 million downloads and 22,000 GitHub stars. His tools are widely used across academia, industry, and government, including by NASA, Tesla, Morgan Stanley, and the U.S. Senate. He has received numerous honors such as the Capital One Research Award, Amazon Research Awards, AAAI New Faculty Highlights, Google Cloud Research Innovators, Norton Lab Fellowship, Meta AI4AI Research Award, and the Carnegie Mellon University Presidential Fellowship. He also serves as an Associate or Action Editor for ACM Transactions on AI for Science, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, and Journal of Data-Centric Machine Learning Research, and as an Area Chair for major conferences including ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS.
